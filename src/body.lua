-- bodies are objects with a position and velocity
-- there are three types of bodies, dynamic bodies that
-- collide with all types of bodies, static bodies that do not
-- move and kinematic bodies that only collide with dynamic bodies
--
-- a bodies shape is described by a collection of hitboxes
-- hitboxes serve two main purposes, they can be solid and collide with other hitboxes
-- for physics or they can be non-solid logic hitboxes that describe the area
-- an attack hits, areas a player can interact with objects, environment
-- damage areas etc.
-- these collections of hitboxes are called fixtures (src/fixture.lua)
--
-- bodies are used in the game mainly for two purposes, the geometry and trigger areas of a map
-- is a static body and entities have dynamic/kinematic bodies for physics with the world and
-- interaction with other entities
